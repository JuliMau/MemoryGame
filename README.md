# **Matching Game**
This is a very simple game to test your memory.
### **About the Game**
You get a deck of **16** cards representing simple symbols, meaning 2 cards are representing the same symbol.

The cards are shuffled and put on the desk.
Click on each card and find a pair for it.

The match is indicated by the _light green color_. If the picked card didn't match with the other one it will be indicated by the _red color_.

Here is no time limits or difficulty levels.
### **Game Conditions**
Game is over when you have found **8 pairs of cards**.

You will see your _time,
star rating and
moves_ indicated during the game on the score panel above the desk.

#### **Timer**
The timer starts upon the first move. You can click on 'Restart'-button next to the timer any time to reset the game, and the timer will be set then again to 0.

#### **Moves**
When you click on two cards (matched or unmatched), it counts as a _move_.
You can reset the move counter the same way as the timer.

#### **Star Rating**
The fewer moves you make to find the pairs the better your star rating is.
The best result is the **three green stars**, while the worst is the one green star.

At the start, you get _**3 light green colored stars**
_.
* If you find all the pairs under  **12 moves**, you don't loose any of your green stars.
* Your **first green** star turns into **black** when you have made the **12th move.**
- You get the **second black** star after the **16th move.**

#### **Congratulation Panel**

When the game is over you will see a pop-up that indicates your **total**  _game time,  star rating and moves_ counted during the game.

It also contains the 'Restart' -button, so you can start a new game right from the panel.
